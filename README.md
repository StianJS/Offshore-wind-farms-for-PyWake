A part of my master's thesis was to make and publish models of offshore wind farms.

These models are made to be compatible and to be used in the same way as shown in the PyWake Quickstart tutorial: https://topfarm.pages.windenergy.dtu.dk/PyWake/notebooks/Quickstart.html

The wind farms modelled are Borssele I & II, Borssele III & IV, the Borssele wind farm zone, Borkum Riffgrund II and Hornsea project 2.

Note: These models are made from data from public sources and have not been validated
